        <h3>Trying to be a world class web developer</h3>
        <p>It’s my reality now, coffee, laptop and phone on DND. Why? Because I am learning, I am trying to restore all my knowledge and even more, to get the new skills. When I was a student, I didn’t write much code and because of it I need now to raise pace and to code more, to be ready for interviews and my new workplace.Thank you for stay with me, I will continue to update and to share with you my experience in finding a job</p>
